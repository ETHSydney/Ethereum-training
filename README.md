# Ethereum Training Material
This is a repository for the SydEthereum development workshop on 19 June 2016 at Tyro Fintech Hub http://www.meetup.com/SydEthereum/events/231618203/

##Pre workshop
Attendees will need a laptop with node.js installed on it. Node.js can be downloaded from
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

If you are not on a Windows machine then it's recommended that you install Node Version Manager. NVM allows you to easily swtich between different version of node.js which might be supported by different node.js servers, frameworks or libraries. Installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/creationix/nvm
